Awesome ambition. Here’s a production-grade roadmap that treats this like an HFT-style, ultra-low-latency Rust project. Each stage yields a working artifact, layers in theory (OS/DSA/CN/COA/Compilers), and bakes in measurement, profiling, and reliability from day one.

---

# Stage 0 — Project kickoff & performance harness (Week 0–1)

**What you’ll build**

* `rs-chess/` workspace with crates:

  * `engine/` (core board, movegen, search)
  * `uci/` (protocol + CLI)
  * `bench/` (micro/macro benchmarks, perft driver)
* Baseline perf harness: `cargo-criterion` benches and a `perft` CLI that prints nodes, nodes/s, and correctness checks.
* CI (GitHub Actions) running tests + benches on `--profile release`.

**Rust + build flags (HFT-flavored)**

* `Cargo.toml` release profile: `opt-level=3`, `lto="thin"`, `codegen-units=1`, `panic="abort"`, `debug=false`, `incremental=false`.
* Runtime CPU tuning flag via env: `RUSTFLAGS="-C target-cpu=native"` (document a fallback for portable binaries).
* Optional allocators via feature flags: `mimalloc` / `jemalloc` (measure, don’t assume).

**What to master first**

* *OS*: processes vs threads, CPU affinity, huge pages basics, NUMA overview; Linux perf toolchain install.
* *COA*: cache hierarchy, cache lines, TLB, branch prediction, prefetchers.
* *Compiler*: LTO, PGO (you’ll use later), inlining & code size tradeoffs, monomorphization.
* *DSA*: memory layout, AoS vs SoA; fixed-capacity arenas.

**Performance practice**

* Tools: `perf stat`, `perf record`, `FlameGraph`, `cargo-criterion`, `cargo-asm`, `cargo-llvm-lines`, `heaptrack` (or `dhat`), `rr`.
* Baseline empty benchmark (do-nothing loop) to verify timing noise and CPU pinning.

**Exit criteria**

* CI green; `perft --position startpos --depth 1..5` runs and reports times (even if node count is 0 at this point).
* You can collect a flamegraph from the binary.

---

# Stage 1 — Board representation on bitboards (Week 1–2)

**What you’ll build**

* `Board` with 12 piece bitboards + side/ep/castling + a unified occupancy mask.
* Zobrist hashing scaffold (random keys, side/castling/en-passant).
* FEN parse/format + repetition stack (hash history).

**Learn before/while coding**

* *DSA*: bitboards, bit-twiddling (popcnt, tzcnt/lzcnt), incremental state updates.
* *COA*: data alignment, false sharing, hot/cold splitting (`#[cold]` for slow paths).
* *Compiler*: inspect codegen for popcount/ctz; use intrinsics conditionally (BMI1/BMI2, POPCNT, LZCNT) with `is_x86_feature_detected!`.

**Performance practice**

* Represent flags in a compact struct that fits in one cache line (e.g., 64–128B total Board hot path).
* Provide `#[inline]` judiciously; measure I-cache pressure with `cargo-llvm-lines`.

**Exit criteria**

* `Board` create/clone/apply-null-move < 50 ns on your dev box (measure with criterion).
* Zobrist hash is stable and changes on legal state transitions.

---

# Stage 2 — Pseudolegal move generation v1 (Week 2–3)

**What you’ll build**

* Non-sliding moves (knight/king/pawns) using precomputed attack tables.
* Sliding moves using **magic bitboards** (default) with optional **PEXT** path (BMI2) behind a feature flag:

  * `--features pext` uses `_pext_u64` if `bmi2` present; else fallback to magic.
* Generate captures and quiets; no legality check yet.

**Learn**

* *DSA*: perfect hashing for magic bitboards; table sizing trade-offs; memory locality.
* *COA*: branch elimination vs branch prediction; table lookups vs arithmetic; PEXT vs magic cost model.
* *Compiler*: function specialization, `#[inline(always)]` risks, code bloat.

**Performance practice**

* Separate capture/quiet generation functions (better move ordering later).
* Store attack tables in `.rodata` aligned; warm them on init (optional).

**Exit criteria**

* Perft (pseudo-legal) matches known node counts ignoring legality for a selected depth on test positions.
* Move generation ≥ 150–250M moves/s single-thread (dev CPU dependent; measure and record).

---

# Stage 3 — Legal movegen & perft correctness (Week 3–4)

**What you’ll build**

* King-in-check detection; pin/mask logic; legal move filter.
* `perft` that matches standard test suites to depth 6–7.
* Property tests (proptest) + differential tests vs a reference engine in **perft only** (input/output, not linking).

**Learn**

* *DSA*: incremental checkers & pinned masks.
* *OS*: sanitizer ecosystem in Rust: `miri`, `cargo-fuzz`; deterministic builds.
* *Compiler*: UB in `unsafe`; how to wrap intrinsics safely.

**Performance practice**

* Cache pinned/attacked bitboards in `BoardDelta` during make/unmake to avoid recompute.
* `MakeMove` uses a small, preallocated stack frame; consider an arena for `MoveList` with fixed capacity.

**Exit criteria**

* Full correctness against perft suite to depth 6 with zero mismatches.
* `perf stat` shows branch-miss rate acceptably low (< \~5–10% in movegen hot path).

---

# Stage 4 — Search skeleton (Week 4–5)

**What you’ll build**

* Negamax with alpha-beta, iterative deepening, aspiration windows, transposition table stub (no store yet).

**Learn**

* *DSA*: fixed-size ring buffers, history tables, killer stacks.
* *COA*: move ordering effect on cutoff depth; cache locality of TT entries.
* *Compiler*: code layout; hot/cold split; avoiding virtual dispatch.

**Performance practice**

* Preallocate `Stack[depth]` structure (no heap).
* Use `black_box` in microbenches to avoid dead-code elimination.

**Exit criteria**

* Plays legal chess via UCI; search to depth 6–8 quickly (seconds).
* Nodes/s metric tracked; achieve ≥ 1–3 MN/s early baseline (CPU-dependent).

---

# Stage 5 — Transposition table v1 (Week 5–6)

**What you’ll build**

* Fixed-size TT with set-associative buckets (e.g., 4-way) in a large power-of-two array.
* 64-bit hash key; store: key8, depth, score, flag, best move, age.
* Replacement policy: AlwaysReplace + DepthPreferred (prefer deeper entries).
* Concurrency: **lockless, single-writer per probe** using atomics; fall back to striped `parking_lot::Mutex` behind a feature flag if 128-bit atomics unavailable.

**Learn**

* *DSA*: hash tables and replacement strategies; aging.
* *OS*: memory mapping a large contiguous region; huge pages; NUMA placement; thread pinning.
* *COA*: false sharing (pad bucket arrays); alignment to cache lines.
* *Compiler*: atomic memory orderings (Relaxed/Acquire/Release) and when they’re sufficient.

**Performance practice**

* Pack entries to fit a small number per cache line; keep probe path branch-predicable.
* Optional TT prefetch with `core::arch::_mm_prefetch`.

**Exit criteria**

* Branch factor reduction observed; Elo jump in self-play vs Stage 4.
* TT hit rate and collision stats logged (behind a non-debug, low-overhead counter).

---

# Stage 6 — Quiescence, pruning & time management (Week 6–7)

**What you’ll build**

* Quiescence search (captures, checks optionally later).
* Pruning: null-move, late move reductions (LMR), futility/pruning guards, razoring (carefully).
* Time manager: steady clock, UCI options for fixed depth/nodes/time, fail-safe cutoff.

**Learn**

* *OS*: clocks/timers (CLOCK\_MONOTONIC), priority, `SCHED_FIFO` caveats; guarding against clock jumps.
* *COA*: controlling explosions in node count; micro-branching behavior.
* *Compiler*: profile-guided optimization (PGO) workflow (collect with realistic openings, then build with PGO).

**Performance practice**

* Keep quiescence lean; avoid recursion overhead via tail-ish patterns where safe.
* Prefer arithmetic/bit ops instead of branches for simple bounds.

**Exit criteria**

* Stable time behavior in bullet settings; no time forfeits in 1000-game stress.
* Nodes/s increase and depth gain at given time budget.

---

# Stage 7 — Evaluation v2: incremental features (Week 7–8)

**What you’ll build**

* Tapered eval with piece-square tables, mobility, pawn structure, king safety, passed/isolated/backward pawns, space.

---

# Stage 8 — SMP parallel search (Week 8–10)

**What you’ll build**

* *COA*: scalability limits—TT contention, memory bandwidth saturation.
* *CN* (light): UCI I/O buffering and **TCP\_NODELAY** if you wrap a socket interface (optional GUI link).

**Performance practice**

* Measure scalability from 1→N cores; Amdahl/Gustafson estimation; spot lock contention via perf.
* Avoid global locks in hot paths; use atomics and sharded structures.

**Exit criteria**

* 1.6–2.5× speedup on 4 cores (position-dependent); stable on 8/16 cores with diminishing returns documented.

---

# Stage 9 — SIMD & instruction-level tuning (Week 10–12)

**What you’ll build**

* Fast popcount/bsf/pext/tzcnt wrappers with runtime feature detection.
* Hand-rolled SIMD kernels where it pays (e.g., mobility counts, king safety masks).
* Optional **portable\_simd** path (nightly) behind feature flag; default to `std::arch` intrinsics on stable.

**Learn**

* *COA*: uop throughput/latency, port pressure, front-end vs back-end bottlenecks; I-cache vs D-cache.
* *Compiler*: check emitted asm (`cargo asm`), align hot loops, unroll factors (let LLVM choose; override only if measured).

**Performance practice**

---

# Stage 10 — NNUE (optional but high impact) (Week 12–16)

**What you’ll build**

* NNUE inference in Rust: int8 weights, affine + clipped ReLU; incremental accumulator updates on make/unmake.
* AVX2/AVX-512 path with 16/32-lane dot products; scalar fallback.

**Learn**

* *DSA*: compressed matrices, quantization, cache-tiling.
* *COA*: aligning weights to 64B, prefetch distance, avoiding gather penalties.
* *Compiler*: autovectorization limits; when to use intrinsics.

**Performance practice**

* Keep inference under \~2–5% total time per node (position dependent) after caching.
* Profile accumulator update vs full refresh; verify no correctness drift.

**Exit criteria**

---

# Stage 12 — PGO, packaging, and reproducibility (Week 18–19)

* Crash-only design in hot path (no panics); resilience harness.

**Learn**

* *CN*: distributed testing on a small cluster; TCP sockets, latency tuning (disable Nagle where appropriate), simple controller protocol.

**Performance practice**

**Exit criteria**

* 100k+ game gauntlet stable; zero crashes; Elo progression tracked with confidence intervals.

---

# Stage 14 — Production polish & ergonomics (Week 20+)

**What you’ll build**

* UCI options (hash MB, threads, contempt, skill level), logging levels behind compile-time flags.
* Minimal telemetry (disabled by default) for perf counters in matches you run.
* Documentation site: architecture, data layouts, feature flags, benchmarking protocol.

**Learn**

* *OS*: packaging for Debian/macOS/Windows; code-signing basics.

**Exit criteria**

* A clean `--help`, sensible defaults, and a README that lets others reproduce your benchmarks.

---

## HFT-style coding rules you’ll follow throughout

* **Preallocate & reuse**: no per-node heap allocations; fixed-capacity stacks/buffers.
* **Deterministic hot path**: feature flags disable logs/stats in release builds; counters use relaxed atomics or `Cell` per thread.
* **Data-oriented design**: prefer contiguous arrays; avoid trait objects in hot loops; generic code where it buys monomorphization (watch code size).
* **Low-latency I/O**: line-buffered stdin/stdout for UCI; if using sockets to a GUI, set `TCP_NODELAY`.
* **CPU affinity & NUMA**: pin threads; first-touch initialize big tables on worker threads.
* **Unsafe only at the edges**: wrap intrinsics; test thoroughly; fuzz unsafe boundaries.

---

## Concrete learning checklist (by domain)

**Operating Systems**

* Scheduling, priorities; thread pinning (`sched_setaffinity`), NUMA policies.
* Timers: `CLOCK_MONOTONIC`, timerfd; avoiding `std::time::Instant` pitfalls across platforms.
* Memory: huge pages, mlock, `mmap` for TBs; page faults and their latency.
* Sanitizers & tools: `miri`, `cargo-fuzz`, `perf`, `heaptrack`, `rr`.

**DSA & Algorithms**

* Bitboards, magic/PEXT; Zobrist hashing; fixed-capacity arenas.
* Alpha-beta family: move ordering, TT design, LMR/null-move/quiescence.
* Hash tables: set-associative, aging & replacement; lock-free read/write patterns.

**Computer Networks**

* UCI over pipes vs sockets; buffering; Nagle & `TCP_NODELAY`.
* Simple controller protocol for distributed testing; latency measurement (RTT jitter).
* File I/O over networked FS if relevant; caching strategies.

**Computer Organization & Architecture**

* Cache hierarchy (L1/L2/L3), line sizes, associativity; TLBs; prefetchers.
* Branch prediction behavior; making code branch-friendly or branchless.
* Instruction sets: POPCNT, BMI1/2 (TZCNT/LZCNT/PEXT), AVX2/AVX-512.
* Throughput/latency of uops; port pressure; alignment & padding.

**Compiler Design (pragmatic)**

* LLVM pipeline as it impacts Rust: inlining, vectorization, loop unrolling.
* Monomorphization & code bloat; ThinLTO; PGO; `cargo-asm` and MIR/LLVM IR intros.
* Profile counters, cold/hot attributes, and their impact.

---

## Metrics & gates you’ll track

* **Correctness**: perft exact match to depth 6–7; `make/unmake` round-trip invariants; no illegal states.
* **Throughput**: nodes/s at fixed positions and opening suites; track across commits.
* **Scalability**: NPS vs cores; TT hit rate; lock contention %.
* **Latency**: p50/p95/p99 move times in bullet/blitz.
* **Reliability**: crash rate per 100k games (target 0), fuzz coverage.

---

## Daily/weekly operating rhythm (like a PM would run it)

* **Daily**: one micro-benchmark or instrumentation improvement; one correctness test added.
* **Twice weekly**: perf deep-dive (flamegraph review, codegen check of top 2 hot functions).
* **Weekly**: SPRT mini-gauntlet, log Elo deltas; document one design choice + data.

---

## Starter task list (do these now)

1. Create the repo with the three crates and the release profile flags.
2. Implement `Board` + Zobrist + FEN; write criterion benches for `make_unmake` and `hash_update`.
3. Add `perft` CLI skeleton and CI with `--release` tests.
4. Set up `perf` + FlameGraph and verify you can capture a profile.

From here, progress through the stages in order. If you hit a perf wall, stop and measure—no “optimizations” without evidence. This plan will get you to a fast, production-credible Rust engine while building the systems foundation you’ll need for Google-scale or HFT-style work.
